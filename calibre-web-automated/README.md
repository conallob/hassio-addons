# Home Assistant Add-on: Calibre-Web Automated

[Calibre-Web Automated](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated)
(CWA) is a self-hosted ebook library manager: a Calibre-Web fork with a
watched ingest folder, automatic format conversion, cover/metadata
enforcement and Kepub conversion for Kobo devices, wrapped around a Calibre
library.

This add-on tracks upstream [Calibre-Web Automated releases](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/releases)
directly — the add-on's `version` field is the CWA release it bundles (see
`build.yaml`'s `CWA_VERSION` for the exact upstream git tag fetched at build
time).

## About

CWA bundles a real Calibre install, [kepubify](https://github.com/pgaskin/kepubify)
and several background workers (ingest watcher, metadata change detector,
nightly library zipper, checksum backfill, process recovery) on top of the
Calibre-Web Flask app. Upstream distributes it as a single Docker image built
on `ghcr.io/linuxserver/baseimage-ubuntu`. This add-on instead builds those
same pieces — the CWA application, Calibre, and kepubify — directly on the
official Home Assistant Debian base image, fetching each from its own
upstream source rather than using a third-party image as the base.

Because it reassembles a fairly large upstream project (Calibre plus a full
Python/Flask app plus several s6 services) rather than a single static
binary, this is a best-effort initial port: it has not been build- or
run-verified against a live Supervisor install. Please open an issue with
build/runtime logs if something doesn't come up cleanly.
